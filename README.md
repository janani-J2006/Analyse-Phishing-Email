# Phishing Email Analysis

This project contains a phishing email analysis task where a suspicious email is inspected for spoofing, fake links, urgency, and header manipulation.

In this project, I analyzed a sample phishing email as part of my internship task at Elevated Labs.
Although I did not receive this email in my real inbox, I worked with a simulated phishing email ‚Äî a realistic example designed to help me learn to detect red flags like spoofed sender addresses, fake links, urgent language, and header manipulation.

I extracted and examined the email‚Äôs header using tools like MxToolbox, and documented the SPF failure, DKIM issues, and IP path anomalies that indicate email spoofing.

I also identified social engineering techniques used in the message, such as urgency and vague greetings.

This project helped me develop practical skills in email threat analysis, header reading, and phishing detection, even without sending or receiving a real message.

## üîß Tools Used
- VS Code
- MxToolbox
- Markdown
- Header Analyzer

## üìÇ Project Structure
- Phishing Email Analysis Report.md: Full report with screenshots
- Header_Result.txt: Raw header from the phishing sample
- screenshots/: Folder containing images of phishing content and analysis

Now, check each part to see if it‚Äôs fake. Here's what to look for:

üîé What to Check	                    ‚úÖ What You Should See	                       ‚ùå What Phishing Looks Like

   Greeting	                             Your name (like "Dear Janani")	                Just "Dear customer" or "User"

## Header Analysis Summary
Checked via: https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx

**SPF Check**: Failed ‚Äì the sender domain is not authorized.

**DKIM**: Not signed ‚Äì no digital signature to prove authenticity.

**Return-Path**: Different from "From" field.

**Received Path**: Shows redirection through multiple suspicious IPs.

## Conclusion: Is this Phishing?
Yes, this is a phishing email.
It shows multiple red flags including spoofed sender address, suspicious links, header mismatches, and social engineering techniques.

## Recommended Action
Do not click any links or download attachments.

Report the email to your IT/security team.

Block sender and flag email as phishing in your email client.

Educate users about phishing signs.

## üìå Outcome
Successfully identified phishing techniques and learned email header analysis.
